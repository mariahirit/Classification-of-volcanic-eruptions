# Classification-of-volcanic-eruptions(Hackathon):

This Kernel was made for the Data Science project of the "Hackathon Jornada de Talent Digital". It aims to predict 5 different classes of volcanic erruptions. Our independent variables are 6 features which represent the sensors. The features are quantitative whilist our target variable is categorical. For the purpose of following the rules of the hackathon we will use the Random Forest classifier, since it's imperative by the hackathon's rules.
